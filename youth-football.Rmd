#STATES WITH POPULATION DATA

#Let's try to add in some population data and try to figure out the number of Power 5 football players per 100,000 residents in a state
#First, let's get ourselves a dataframe that has state postal abbreviations and their most recent ACS state population:
state_pops_2021 <- get_acs(geography = "state",
                           variables = "B01003_001",

  left_join(state_crosswalk, by=c("name_caps" = "state_name_caps"))

state_pops_2021 <- state_pops_2021 %>%
  select(state_abb, estimate) %>%
    filter(!is.na(state_abb)) #Removed NA value, which was Puerto Rico

# Now, let's join our population data to our state count of football players data:
football_rosters_usa_states <- football_rosters_usa_states %>%
  inner_join(state_pops_2021, by=c("hometown_state_clean" = "state_abb"))

football_rosters_usa_states <- football_rosters_usa_states %>%
